# Roadmap

## Completed milestones

### v0.2.0 — Upload, Metadata & Backup (shipped 2026-04-14)

Enabled AI agents to upload books to ABS, apply metadata from providers, and
create safety-net backups. CLI provides sharp primitives; agents orchestrate.

- **Backup** — `abs-cli backup create|list|apply|download|delete|upload` (admin-only).
- **Upload** — `abs-cli upload` with author/series/sequence folder naming, `--wait` polling.
- **Scan** — `abs-cli libraries scan` (async) and `abs-cli items scan` (sync).
- **Metadata** — `abs-cli metadata search|providers|covers` against ABS-configured providers.
- **Tasks** — `abs-cli tasks list` for polling background task status.
- **Permission errors** — Improved error messages for 403/400/404/500 across all commands.
- **Testing** — `uploaduser` test user, permission denial smoke tests, gated external provider tests.

Full spec: [docs/specs/2026-04-12-v0.2.0-upload-metadata-backup.md](specs/2026-04-12-v0.2.0-upload-metadata-backup.md)

Follow-ups shipped in v0.2.1 – v0.2.7: AOT serialization fixes, ABS 2.33.x
compatibility, upload `relPath` + sanitize-drift coverage, batch-update verb fix.

### v0.3.0 — Changelog, cover handling & .NET 10 LTS (shipped 2026-04-29)

Bundled release notes, agent-driven cover management, and a .NET 10 LTS upgrade.

- **`abs-cli changelog` command** — Print the most recent entry by default;
  `--all` prints the full file. Source of truth is the bundled
  `CHANGELOG.md`, embedded in the assembly so the command works offline.
- **`items cover set|get|remove`** — Apply (`--url` / `--file` /
  `--server-path`), fetch (to file or stdout), and remove book covers.
  Composes with `items list --filter "missing=cover"` and `metadata covers`
  for a full cover-handling workflow.
- **Target framework upgraded to .NET 10 LTS** — Dev container, CI matrix,
  and all three csproj files. AOT trimmer improvements dropped the
  Linux-x64 binary from ~11 MB to ~8.7 MB.
- **`System.CommandLine` 2.0.0-beta4 → 2.0.7 stable** — Custom help-section
  infrastructure rewritten against the new action-based help model;
  user-facing help format is byte-for-byte identical to before.
- **Build-time NuGet audit gate** — `Directory.Build.props` with
  `WarningsAsErrors` for NU1901-NU1904. Combined with Dependabot security
  updates, CVEs in dependencies now surface as build failures.

Full notes: see [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) or `abs-cli changelog`.

### v0.4.0 — Author management & items-search cleanup (shipped 2026-05-11)

Expand the author surface for agent-driven metadata cleanup, and drop the
duplicate `items search` subcommand.

- **Author pagination (breaking)** — `abs-cli authors list` switched to the
  paginated response shape `{ results, total, limit, page }` with
  `--limit`, `--page`, `--sort` (`name` / `lastFirst` / `addedAt` /
  `updatedAt` / `numBooks`), `--desc`. Callers that read `.authors` must
  switch to `.results`.
- **`abs-cli authors match` / `lookup`** — Audnexus-backed match
  (`POST /api/authors/:id/match`, destructive — writes
  `asin`/`imagePath`/`description`) and the read-only probe
  (`GET /api/search/authors?q=`).
- **`abs-cli authors update` / `delete`** — Edit `name` / `description` /
  `asin` (tri-state per field: set / clear via empty string / leave alone).
  Surfaces ABS's silent-merge-on-rename by returning
  `{ merged: true, author: <target> }` instead of `{ updated, author }`.
  `delete` unlinks from all books.
- **`abs-cli authors image set|get|remove`** — Author images via URL
  download (`set --url`), file/stdout (`get --output`), or DELETE
  (`remove`).
- **Deprecated `abs-cli items search` removed (breaking)** — Duplicate of
  top-level `abs-cli search`. The help-text-level deprecation was in place
  through v0.2.x and v0.3.0; v0.4.0 ships the hard removal.

Full notes: see [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) or `abs-cli changelog`.

## Next

### v0.5.0 — File management

Four primitives for working with the files behind a library item: merge
multi-file audiobooks into a single tagged `.m4b`, pull external chapter
metadata, embed ABS's current metadata into the audio files themselves
(which today's `items update` and friends do not do — they only persist
to ABS's DB and sidecar), and toggle which ebook file is the item's
primary when multiple formats are present. All four target the
admin/agent metadata-cleanup loop and all four sit on top of existing
ABS endpoints (no proxy work, no new server features).

- **Encode to single `.m4b`** — Wrap ABS's
  `POST /api/tools/item/:id/encode-m4b` (admin-only) so agents can
  consolidate multi-file audiobooks into a single tagged `.m4b`. ABS
  concatenates `media.includedAudioFiles` through ffmpeg, embeds
  chapters + cover, writes the result to the item's library directory,
  **and automatically moves the original tracks out of the library dir**
  (into the server's metadata cache as a backup) — so the post-task
  library state is a single-file m4b without any extra CLI cleanup.
  Pairs with existing `tasks list` for progress polling; add `--wait`
  for in-CLI blocking. `DELETE /api/tools/item/:id/encode-m4b` cancels
  a running task. Research:
  [docs/specs/research/2026-05-11-m4b-encode-merge.md](specs/research/2026-05-11-m4b-encode-merge.md).
  Spec: [docs/specs/2026-05-12-v0.5.0-encode-m4b.md](specs/2026-05-12-v0.5.0-encode-m4b.md).
  Plan: [docs/plans/2026-05-12-v0.5.0-encode-m4b.md](plans/2026-05-12-v0.5.0-encode-m4b.md).
- **External chapter metadata lookup** — Expose
  `GET /api/search/chapters?asin=<asin>&region=<r>` (Audnexus-backed,
  same backing service as `authors match`/`lookup`). Returns Audnexus's
  chapter shape (`{ asin, chapters: [{ title, lengthMs, startOffsetMs,
  startOffsetSec }, ...], runtimeLengthSec, isAccurate, ... }`) which
  the agent can diff against an item's existing `media.chapters` and
  write back via the existing `POST /api/items/:id/chapters` (likely
  needs a new `items chapters set` command too, plus a units note
  since Audnexus is ms-based and the write endpoint takes seconds).
  Research:
  [docs/specs/research/2026-05-11-external-chapter-metadata.md](specs/research/2026-05-11-external-chapter-metadata.md).
- **Embed ABS metadata into the audio files** — Expose ABS's
  `POST /api/tools/item/:id/embed-metadata` (admin-only). The existing
  ABS metadata write endpoints (and the CLI commands that wrap them —
  `items update`, planned `items chapters set`, `authors update`, etc.)
  only update ABS's database and sidecar file; the audio files
  themselves stay untouched. `embed-metadata` is the in-place ffmpeg
  pass that reads ABS's current state and bakes the tags, cover, and
  chapters into the files. Optional `forceEmbedChapters=1` to include
  chapters on multi-file books; `backup=1` keeps a server-side copy
  before the rewrite. Batch variant at
  `POST /api/tools/batch/embed-metadata`. Research:
  [docs/specs/research/2026-05-11-embed-metadata.md](specs/research/2026-05-11-embed-metadata.md).
- **Toggle ebook primary status** — Wrap ABS's
  `PATCH /api/items/:id/ebook/:fileid/status` for library items that hold
  more than one ebook file (e.g. `.epub` + `.pdf` of the same book). The
  endpoint is a *toggle*, not a setter: calling it on a supplementary
  file promotes it to primary and ABS auto-demotes the previously-primary
  file in the same call; calling it on the current primary unsets it,
  leaving the item with no primary ebook (both files end up
  supplementary). The toggle and the "no primary after unsetting" sharp
  edge must be documented in `--help`, not just here. `:fileid` is the
  file's `ino`, already exposed under `libraryFiles[].ino` in `items
  get`. Likely command shape: `items toggle-ebook-status <itemId>
  <fileIno>` — matches the server's literal semantics over a
  friendlier-but-misleading `set-primary`. Audio files have no equivalent
  endpoint; ABS treats audio tracks as an ordered sequence, not a
  primary/alternates set. Research:
  [docs/specs/research/2026-05-12-ebook-primary-toggle.md](specs/research/2026-05-12-ebook-primary-toggle.md).

### v0.6.0 — TBD

- **`items delete`** — Add support for more destructive commands.
- **`login --username` / `--password`** — Add non-interactive credential parameters to the `login` command.

## Ideas

Not yet scoped — notes to pick up later.

_None currently. New ideas land here before getting scheduled into a release._

## Deferred features

All are additive — nothing in the v1 architecture blocks them.

| Feature | Reason for deferral |
|---------|-------------------|
| Table output (`--table` via Spectre.Console) | JSON-only sufficient for v1; agents don't need tables |
| Episodes resource | No podcast libraries in current use |
| Collections / Playlists resources | Not needed for metadata workflow |
| `items files` / `items progress` | Playback and file management not in scope |
